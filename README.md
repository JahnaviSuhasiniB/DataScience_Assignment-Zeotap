Requirements
Python 3.7 or above
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

Results
Clustering: Identified meaningful clusters within the dataset.
EDA: Uncovered patterns, trends, and distributions in the data.
Lookalike Model: Built a model to find similar users based on key metrics.
